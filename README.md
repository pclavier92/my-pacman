# My Pacman

My Pacman is a simplified version of the game developed using React.js

The idea behind this project was just to have some fun, to think by myself how should the logic of a simple Pacman game be and see up to where I could get.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
